print("Hello World")

# Explanation:
# The print() function in R is used to display text or values to the console.
# In this example, we use print() to output the string "Hello World".

# Running the Program:
# ====================
# To run this script, save it as hello.R and use the following command in the terminal:
#
# Rscript hello.R
#
# This command invokes the Rscript interpreter, which runs the specified R script.
